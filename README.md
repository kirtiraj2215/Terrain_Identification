# Terrain Identification using Semantic Segmentation

This project performs semantic segmentation of terrain types (like grass, rocks, trail, water, mud) using DeepLabV3+ with a ResNet34 encoder, trained on custom annotated terrain datasets.

---

## Project Overview

The goal is to enable machines (e.g., ground robots, drones) to **visually identify and classify terrain types** from RGB images for downstream applications like terrain-aware navigation or path planning.

Training Pipeline Summary
	1.	Dataset loaded from structured raw/ and annotations/ folders
	2.	Custom PyTorch Dataset class handles images and label conversion
	3.	DeepLabV3+ model trained using CrossEntropyLoss
	4.	Checkpoints saved when validation loss improves

‚∏ª

üñºÔ∏è Inference Example

You can use the trained model to predict terrain classes from new images. Example visualization:
	‚Ä¢	Left: Input RGB image
	‚Ä¢	Right: Predicted terrain mask (color-coded)

To test locally or on new data, load the model and run predictions as shown in the notebook.

üîç How to Use

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:

‚ö†Ô∏è Or open the notebook directly in Google Colab for GPU-based training

git clone https://github.com/your-username/terrain-identification.git
cd terrain-identification

2. Run the notebook:

Open TerrainIdentification.ipynb and run each cell step by step.

3. Use the trained model:

You can download or re-use best_model.pth to run inference on any 512√ó512 image.

Let me know if you'd like:
- A **sample image and output gif** added to the README
- GitHub badges for stars, forks, license
- Colab badge (`Open in Colab`)
- Instructions for exporting model to ONNX or TorchScript for deployment

Once ready, I can help you polish the repo description and tags too for discoverability.
